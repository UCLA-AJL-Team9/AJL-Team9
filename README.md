## **🎯 Project Highlights**

**Example:**

* Built a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify dermatological conditions  
* Implemented data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and address skin tone representation  
* Planned fairness evaluation using performance across different skin tone groups  
* Leveraged Kaggle datasets and starter notebooks to create a baseline model

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**WiDS challenge:**

1. What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?
2. How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, “Through poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what’s happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.”
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.
Check out [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKaVNR\_l7Abx2kebs3AdDi6TlPviC3q/view) from the Algorithmic Justice League for inspiration!

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?
